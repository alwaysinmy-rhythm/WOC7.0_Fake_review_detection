# WOC7.0_Fake_review_detection
# Fake Review Detection Web Application

## Motive for the Project

In the AI-driven world, computer-generated reviews have increased significantly. This website aims to help customers by analyzing Amazon product reviews and detecting whether they are human-written or AI-generated. By scanning reviews with an ML model, users can make informed decisions before purchasing products.

## Work Flow

1.  Enter an Amazon product URL.
2.  The website scrapes all reviews using Selenium.
3.  Reviews are preprocessed for analysis.
4.  The ML model (SVM) scans the reviews and classifies them as human-written or computer-generated.
5.  The classified reviews are displayed on the website.

## Technology Used

*   Flask - For building the web application.
*   SVM Model - For classifying reviews.
*   Selenium - For web scraping Amazon reviews.

## Improvements

*   Enhance the preprocessing techniques for better review analysis.
*   Replace SVM with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve accuracy.
*   Expand the websiteâ€™s functionality to support other e-commerce platforms beyond Amazon.

## How to Run
